# Luke Jeon - My Summer in Markdown

## What did I do over the summer?
Because I had significantly more time over the summer, I was able to meet many of my friends that I am typically unable to see as most of them live in Irvine. I was also able to spend time with graduating friends. Many of them are planning to attend university out of state, so it was enjoyable to spend time with them before they left. I also spent time with some school friends, playing sports, fishing, and watching movies with them. I also traveled to Europe (London, Brussels, Ghent, and Amsterdam) with friends and family.

I additionally spent time on productive tasks over the summer. Some of these include:
- I was able to publish research on quantatative economics through ML analysis through IEEE.
- My research from the previous summer was indexed by IEEE and can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/documnet/10535008)
- I expanded my non-profit organization to operations in 5 countries
- I started my college applications!

*Overall, my summer was relaxing, enjoyable, and productive.*


## What songs did I listen to over the summer?
I listened mostly to Korean R&B/Ballads and classical music.

Some of my favorite composers of the summer were Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. My favorite compositions from them were Piano Concerto No. 1 by Tchaikovsky and Piano Concerto No. 3 by Rachmaninoff.

In London, my friend intoduced to some French R&B, which I have been enjoying more often.


## What are my favorite foods?
Over the summer, I enjoyed Japanese-style chicken curry katsu, which is one of my favorite foods. Because there are few good places in LA, I had to drive to Irvine or Satel to eat with friends there.

I also enjoyed Korean BBQ with friends. My other favorite food is Yorkshire pudding and Sunday Roast, but this is a food I will eat more often during the winter season.


## What sports do I play?
I enjoy the following sports:

- Tennis
- Snowboarding
- Long-distance running
- Swimming

Although I enjoy snowboarding the most, I was unable to practice this summer. I spent the majority of my time in sports playing tennis with friends who are leaving for college this semester. I additionally picked up pickleball this summer as it's similar to tennis.


## What do I want to achieve this year?
I want to do well acedemically (all A's) and I also want to challenge myself by getting into a good political science undergraduate program.

I've already begun the application process, but I want to spend the majority of my time in the first semester perfecting my application.

I also want to work on a start-up that I've founded towards the end of summer. The start-up is more defesne oriented, and the organization's current goal is to sell a new kind of smart loitering munition design to Lockheed Martin or Raytheon Defense for a video game pass.

Finally, I want to try and get municipal legislature passed over by November 1st in support of an effort to pass two state bills through a student lobbying group I founded.
